This is a work in progress!

For this test to even compile, you will need to create the include file:

src/yammer-api-keys.hrl

and include your API KEY & SECRET provided by Yammer for your app.

For example:
-define(CONSUMER_KEY, "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx").
-define(CONSUMER_SECRET, "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX").

Once created, just run: 
make run

and you should see the result!
